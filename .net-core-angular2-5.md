# how to add exception routes to have angular handle routes and non-routes.

Angular handles routes only it has registered in angular routes
angular routes image references to server
use staticfiles enables direction to html pages, images, js files
spa-fallback ensures reroute of other routes to index page which includes angular and hence angular takes over routing for those views


```
app.UseDefaultFiles();
app.UseStaticeFiles();

app.UseMvc(routes =>
{
    routes.MapRoute(
        name: "default",
        template: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");

    routes.MapSpaFallbackRoute(
            name: "spa-fallback",
            defaults: new { controller = "Home", action = "Index" });
});
```


# multiple applets
