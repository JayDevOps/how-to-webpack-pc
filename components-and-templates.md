# Components
Components are the fundamental unit for UI reuse and composition. Need to compose a UI structure, use component from basic building blocks like buttons to complex buttons
# Templating
Templating is used for dynamic imposition of text or content

# Reference from VueJS
<https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/syntax.html>
The contents of the span will be replaced with the value of the rawHtml property, interpreted as plain HTML - data bindings are ignored. Note that you cannot use v-html to compose template partials, because Vue is not a string-based templating engine. Instead, components are preferred as the fundamental unit for UI reuse and composition.
